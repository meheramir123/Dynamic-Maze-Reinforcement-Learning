# Dynamic-Maze-Reinforcement-Learning
A custom **Dynamic Maze Environment** built with **Gymnasium** and **Pygame**, where the layout changes every episode. The goal is to train a reinforcement learning agent using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to navigate the maze, collect rewards, avoid traps, and reach the goal.
